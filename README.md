# Automated-ASR
This is a python code that automates the workflow of Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction.
It's written in Python3, and the command lines may be different depnding on the executables for IQTree, MAFFT, and CD-Hit in your system.
The current version (0.8) should also produce libraries of degenerate DNA sequences from each ancestral sequence.
